# Commodore 64 Prototyping Cartridge

Prototyping Cartridge for C64 designed in "Express PCB" v7.0.2.

[ not produced, untested ]

In free time I designed prototyping cartridge, which can fit into cartridge case from www.icomp.de . Cartridge shape is based on MMC Replay.

Why "Express PCB"? You may ask. I found it easy for me to add my own components to design and was easy to learn. It has limitations of its own but I found it more challenging when designing something ;)
